## Postman Integration
To test the API endpoints, you can use Postman:

1. **Download Postman**: If you don't have Postman installed, you can download it from [Postman's official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2. **Import the Postman Collection**: 
   - Open Postman.
   - Click on "Import" in the top left corner.
   - Select "Upload Files" and choose the Postman collection file `PHP API Challenge.postman_collection.json` located in the `postman/` directory of this repository.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - In Postman, go to "Environments" and create a new environment.
   - Add a variable named `baseUrl` with the value `http://localhost/api`.

4. **Run Requests**:
   - Select the imported collection.
   - Ensure the correct environment is selected.
   - Run the requests to interact with the API.
